# Discrete Time Survival Analysis  

*PyDTS* is a Python package designed for discrete-time survival analysis with competing risks, offering tools for model fitting, evaluation, and simulation.

For details, usage examples, and API information - check out the package 
[documentation](https://tomer1812.github.io/pydts/) 

*PyDTS* offers:

- Discrete-time competing-risks regression models.
- Automated procedures for hyperparameter tuning.
- Sure Independence Screening methods for feature selection.
- Model evaluation metrics for predictive accuracy and calibration.
- Simulation tools for generating synthetic datasets for research and testing.

Additional simulations and illustrative examples are available in [Meir and Gorfine (2025), Discrete-Time Competing-Risks Regression with or without Penalization, Biometrics (2025)](https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/81/2/ujaf040/8120014), and in the accompanying [Github Repository](https://github.com/tomer1812/DiscreteTimeSurvivalPenalization/tree/main)

## Installation

*PyDTS* can be installed using PyPI as follows:

```console
pip install pydts
```

## Quick Start

The following example demonstrates how to generate synthetic data and fit a `TwoStagesFitter` model.

Detailed definitions and explanations are available in the [methods section](https://tomer1812.github.io/pydts/methods/) of the documentation. 

The function `generate_quick_start_df` simulates a dataset with the following defaults:  

- **Sample size**: `n_patients=10000`  
- **Covariates**: `n_cov=5` independent covariates, each drawn from Uniform(0,1) distribution 
- **Competing events**: `j_events=2` event types  
- **Time scale**: `d_times=14` discrete time intervals  
- **Hazard coefficients** (default values):  
  - $\alpha_{1t}$ = −1 − 0.3 * log(t)  
  - $\alpha_{2t}$ = −1.75 − 0.15 * log(t)
  - $\beta_1$ = −log([0.8, 3, 3, 2.5, 2])  
  - $\beta_2$ = −log([1, 3, 4, 3, 2])  

For each patient, a censoring time $C$ is drawn from Uniform{1, ..., 14}.
The observed time is defined as $X = min(T, C)$, where $T$ is the event time which is sampled based on the covariates of each patient and the hazard coefficients.
If censoring occurs before the event ($C < T$), the event type is set to $J = 0$.

Once the dataset is generated, you can fit a `TwoStagesFitter` to the data (without columns $C$ and $T$ which are not observed in practice).

You can generate synthetic data and fit your first `TwoStagesFitter` model with the following code: 

```python
from pydts.fitters import TwoStagesFitter
from pydts.examples_utils.generate_simulations_data import generate_quick_start_df

# Generate a synthetic dataset with 10,000 patients,
# 5 covariates, 14 discrete time intervals, and 2 competing events
patients_df = generate_quick_start_df(n_patients=10000, n_cov=5, d_times=14, j_events=2, pid_col='pid', seed=0)

# Initialize and fit the discrete-time competing-risk model
fitter = TwoStagesFitter()
fitter.fit(df=patients_df.drop(['C', 'T'], axis=1))

# Display model summary
fitter.print_summary()
```
